# Error Handling Best Practices

When implementing error handling in the 2Click Broker project:

1. Use try-catch blocks for async operations and potential runtime errors.

2. Create custom error classes for specific error types in your application.

3. Use the `NextResponse` object to return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.

4. Log errors on the server-side for debugging and monitoring purposes.

5. Implement global error handling for uncaught exceptions.

6. Use error boundaries in React components to catch and handle errors in the component tree.

7. Provide user-friendly error messages in the UI while logging detailed error information on the server.

8. Handle network errors and timeouts gracefully, providing retry options when appropriate.

9. Implement proper error handling for third-party service integrations (e.g., Stripe, Clerk).

10. Use TypeScript to catch type-related errors at compile-time.
